"Enhancing knowledge discovery from multiple data sets using multiple support vector machines . A system and method for enhancing knowledge discovery from data using multiple learning machines in general and multiple support vector machines in particular. Training data for a learning machine is pre-processed in order to add meaning thereto. Pre-processing data may involve transforming the data points and/or expanding the data points. By adding meaning to the data, the learning machine is provided with a greater amount of information for processing. With regard to support vector machines in particular, the greater the amount of information that is processed, the better generalizations about the data that may be derived. Multiple support vector machines, each comprising distinct kernels, are trained with the pre-processed training data and are tested with test data that is pre-processed in the same manner. The test outputs from multiple support vector machines are compared in order to determine which of the test outputs if any represents a optimal solution. Selection of one or more kernels may be adjusted and one or more support vector machines may be retrained and retested. Optimal solutions based on distinct input data sets may be combined to form a new input data set to be input into one or more additional support vector machine."

"Method, system, and computer program product for visualizing a data structure . A data structure visualization tool visualizes a data structure such as a decision table classifier. A data file based on a data set of relational data is stored as a relational table, where each row represents an aggregate of all the records for each combination of values of the attributes used. Once loaded into memory, an inducer is used to construct a hierarchy of levels, called a decision table classifier, where each successive level in the hierarchy has two fewer attributes. Besides a column for each attribute, there is a column for the record count (or more generally, sum of record weights), and a column containing a vector of probabilities (each probability gives the proportion of records in each class). Finally, at the top-most level, a single row represents all the data. The decision table classifier is then passed to the visualization tool for display and the decision table classifier is visualized. By building a representative scene graph adaptively, the visualization application never loads the whole data set into memory. Interactive techniques, such as drill-down and drill-through are used view further levels of detail or to retrieve some subset of the original data. The decision table visualizer helps a user understand the importance of specific attribute values for classification."

"Node-enabled monitoring of a piece of equipment using a hierarchical node network . Methods and systems are described for monitoring a piece of equipment using a hierarchical node network having at least an ID node, a master node, and a server. The ID node is associated with the equipment, can monitor equipment operations, and communicate directly with the master node but is unable to directly communicate with the server. The master node can directly communicate with the server and separately communicate with the ID node. The master node associates with the ID node when the master node detects a signal broadcast from the ID node. The server then determines a location of the ID node. The ID node detects an actionable event related to the operation of the equipment, and transmits a message reporting the actionable event to the master node. The master node notifies the server about the actionable event. Thereafter, the server initiates a responsive action based upon the notification."
