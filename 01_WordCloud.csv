System and method for capture of qualified compliance data at point of clinical care,"A system and related techniques generate and maintain a set of compliance-qualified data schemas or templates for deployment in a hospital or other clinical setting. According to conventional implementations, the clinical data required by regulatory reporting bodies such as CMS (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services), JCAHO (Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations) or other government or private bodies may not be systematically captured or track, so that compliance officers and other managers are left to reconstruct compliance data after the face, for instance from patient accounting systems or other platforms not designed to filter or store regulatory data. Platforms and methods according to the invention, in contrast, may access regulatory or compliance criteria and generate a data capture or documented care template, according to which various clinical measures and other information which are required by compliance bodies are automatically captured, at the point of care. Thus patient labs, tests, outcomes and other clinically related data may be conditioned to include that information demanded by regulatory standards, including lab ratios and others, and that data may be automatically recorded, stored, and in embodiments, transmitted to regulatory bodies or agencies, electronically. The regulatory data store that results may likewise in embodiments be accessed by analytic tools to model various compliance and clinical scenarios."
